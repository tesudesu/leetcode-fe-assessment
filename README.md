## About

This repository contains my response to LeetCode's HTML/CSS, DOM, React assessment for the Content Team in June 2023.

## Problem Description

Write scripts in vanilla JavaScript and React that format a phone number into the (123) 456-7890 format automatically as a user types into an input field in an HTML form. 

Address the issue of the caret jumping to the end when a user removes digits from the middle of the formatted number.

Optionally, write an editorial.
